        <h4>Things to Do</h4>
         <p>
          Antigua and Barbuda might not feature high on your travel bucket list, but it should. These beautiful tropical islands are, in fact, some of the most beautiful islands in the Caribbean.

Whether it is full-scale resort beaches sporting all the facilities, bays right by the best surfing or snorkeling action or lonesome desert island coves that you covet....
